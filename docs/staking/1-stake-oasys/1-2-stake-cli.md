# Staking with Client


![delegate](/img/docs/techdocs/validator/delegate.png)

## Intro

There are three ways to stake.

1. [Staking using CLI](/docs/hub-validator/operate-validator/1-3-join-validator#4-staking)

When staking using the CLI, you need to export the private key while staking.

2. Staking with Oasys Hub. 

You can use [Oasys Hub](https://hub.oasys.games) for staking. 

3. Direct contract call 

We currently do not support the official way, but we'll provide web for a claim if you are an owner on a validator.
